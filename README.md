# Azure App Service diagnostics 
When you’re running a web application, you want to be prepared for any issues that may arise, from 500 errors to your users telling you that your site is down. App Service diagnostics is an intelligent and interactive experience to help you troubleshoot your app with no configuration required. When you do run into issues with your app, App Service diagnostics points out what’s wrong to guide you to the right information to more easily and quickly troubleshoot and resolve the issue.
